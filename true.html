<h1>Isiah Thieme's page</h1>
hello!
<br/>
My name is Isiah Thieme.

<p>I am a second year student at Saint Mary's College of California. I am currently living on campus. I like how small and quiet the campus is because I went to smaller schools my whole life.   </p>

<p>I am currently in <i>CS 102</i> in Fall 2023.</p>

<p>I decided to come to Saint Mary's College of California because it is close to home and I didn't want to travel far. Also, because I got a good scholarship to attend here. I really like the small enviorment that Saint Mary's has and how easily accessible everything is. Saint Mary's has became a second home for me and I hope to enjoy the rest of my time that I have here! </p>

<p>Hobbies:
<ul>
<li>Gym</li>

<p>Being a Gael is such a blessing for me because us as Gaels never give up and always push through hard times. Saint Mary's has been one of the biggest blessings that has happened to me. It has transformed me as a person and has made me who I am today.</p>

<p>The Raiders is the football team that I support and will always support. being from Oakland has sucked for me because they aren't here anymore. Not being able to go to an Oakland Raiders game sucks because I will never get the experience of going to one probably for ever. I will always be a die heart Raiders fan.</p>
